            <p>While we can't predict the future, we can inspire it. So what will our cars look like and how will they
                function? Will we drive them or will they drive us? That seems to be the question on everyone's mind.
                Well, we have an idea. Cars are for people who want to go to more places safely and efficiently</p>

            <p>Concept-i follows our belief that vehicles shouldn't start with technology—they should start, and end, with the experience of the people who use them. Therefore, Concept-i was built from the inside out, with a focus on making it immersive, energetic and, most importantly—approachable .</p>
